# bq4847-replacement

**Drop-in replacement for the BQ4847Y DIP RTC chip using the BQ4802Y for 5V legacy systems.**  
Maintains full functionality with modern, readily available components.

## Overview

Many legacy computer systems used the BQ4847 real-time clock (RTC) chip‚Äîan integrated lithium coin-cell battery-backed chip with a typical 10-year lifespan. Today, most of these original chips are well beyond their intended service life.

This project provides a drop-in replacement using the newer BQ4802Y clock chip. It includes support for a replaceable 3V CR2032 battery via an XH 2-pin connector. Note that while the original BQ4847 supported an external 512K SRAM module, this project does **not** include that memory. However, the BQ4802Y can still manage external SRAM if present.

This design was created specifically for use in the [TI-99/4A IDE Card](http://www.mainbyte.com/ti99/ide_card/ide_card.html), which has a dedicated footprint for the BQ4847.
