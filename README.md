## Overview

Many legacy computer systems used the BQ4847 real-time clock (RTC) chip‚Äîan integrated lithium coin-cell battery-backed chip with a typical 10-year lifespan. Today, most of these original chips are well beyond their intended service life.

This project provides a drop-in replacement using the newer BQ4802Y clock chip. It includes support for a replaceable 3V CR2032 battery via an XH 2-pin connector. Note that while the original BQ4847 supported an external 512K SRAM module, this project does **not** include that memory. However, the BQ4802Y can still manage external SRAM if present.

This design was created specifically for use in the [TI-99/4A IDE Card](http://www.mainbyte.com/ti99/ide_card/ide_card.html), which has a dedicated footprint for the BQ4847.

## Installation Instructions

### BQ4802 Clock Installation for the TI-99/4A IDE Card

1. **Remove the original BQ4852**  
   Carefully remove the original clock chip and SRAM from IC27 by pulling straight up.

2. **Install SRAM**  
   Ensure a [512Kx8 SRAM chip](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/727-CY2148ELL45ZSXIT) is installed at IC23.

3. **Install Capacitors**  
   Make sure two 0805 SMD capacitors are installed:
   - **C23** ‚Äî for the SRAM
   - **C25** ‚Äî for the new clock chip (BQ4802)

4. **Insert the BQ4802 Clock Chip**  
   Place the BQ4802 into the BQ4847 socket:
   - Align the dot on the BQ4802 with the cutout on the silkscreen (facing C25 and the top edge of the IDE card).
   - The crystal and resistor should be located above the BQ4802 chip.

5. **Attach the Battery**  
   - Connect the battery to the 2-pin connector, observing polarity (**+ is on the left**, per silkscreen).
   - Mount the battery holder nearby using double-stick tape.
   - Leave the battery switch **OFF** for now.

6. **Set the IDE Switch**  
   - Turn the primary IDE switch (rear of the card) to the **OFF** position (usually the middle setting).

7. **Power On System**  
   - Power on your **Peripheral Expansion System**.
   - Power on your **TI-99/4A** and wait for the Master Title Screen.
   - Flip the IDE card switch to **TI** (if using a TI system).

8. **Load the DSR**  
   - Run `IDELOAD` to detect and load the DSR.

9. **Verify Battery Backup**  
   - If successful:
     - Turn the **battery switch ON**
     - Power down and back up.
     - Run `CALL IDEST` or `CALL IDETD` in BASIC to check if date/time was retained.

10. **Troubleshooting**  
    - If unsuccessful:
      - Double-check all connections.
      - Use a multimeter to verify continuity.
      - Confirm that the DSR is still loaded.
      - Use community forums such as the [TI-99/4A Forum on AtariAge](https://forums.atariage.com/forum/164-ti-994a-computers/) for assistance.
